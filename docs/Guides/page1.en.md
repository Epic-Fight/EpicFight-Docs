NOTE: Lastly update at version: 18.1.16

# Custom entity datapack


Epic Fight isn't normally compatible with other mods, especially with the entities. So you have to manually define the entity's model, animations, and other attribute values. This can be achieved by using Datapack.
***

## **üí° Creating a JSON file -**


Before you create a JSON file, you should get the registry name of the entity you want to make compatible. In Minecraft, you can see the list of entities registered now by "/summon" command.

Most of the registry names consist of "modid:entityname". If you get the registry name, you can create the JSON file under
`data/modid/epicfight_mobpatch/entityname.json`
***

## **üí° Getting a path of models and animations -**

[Model files](https://github.com/Yesssssman/epicfightmod/blob/1.18.2/src/main/java/yesman/epicfight/gameasset/Models.java)

[Animation files](https://github.com/Yesssssman/epicfightmod/blob/1.18.2/src/main/java/yesman/epicfight/gameasset/Animations.java)

## **üí° Easy Setup -**

### **üìò Using preset**


For the entities that have the same actions from vanilla ones, You can use a preset. It is very simple as shown below.

```JSON
{
	"preset": "minecraft:creeper"
}
```

You should know that this will not work properly if the target entity doesn't share the code from the vanilla one, although it is seemingly the same. The allowed values are all the entity's registry names that are registered in the [code](https://github.com/Yesssssman/epicfightmod/blob/1.18.2/src/main/java/yesman/epicfight/world/capabilities/provider/ProviderEntity.java)

### **‚ùå Disabling an animated entity**


You also can disable the existing animated entity. It can be done by a simple line.
```JSON
{
	"disabled": true
}
```

***
## **üí° Adding a feature -**


Below is a simple example of creating a punching zombie.
```JSON

	"model": "epicfight:entity/biped_old_texture",
	"renderer": "minecraft:zombie",

## **üí° Changing the animation based on the weapon its holding -**
For the humanoid mobs, you can set different animation sets depending on the weapon they're holding. In this case, the format of the "combat_behaviors" is slightly changed. First, you have to check if you set the "isHumanoid" value to true.

Below is an example of creating a zombie, wielding a swor like a wither skeleton while idle and walking, attacking with a sword, or punching with empty hands.
